# Fake-News-Detection
The Fake News Detection project is a data analysis project that utilizes the ISOT Fake News Dataset to train a model to determine whether inputted data is false or true. The ISOT Fake News Dataset consists of 39,105 news articles labeled as fake and true, collected from various news organizations to ensure accuracy. With this machine learning model, users can input a news article from a 2016 election news article. The model will provide a result indicating whether the article is true or false. This project involves data handling using pandas, text processing with NLTK, feature extraction with TF-IDF, model training, Logistic Regression evaluation, and an inference function to process user input.
